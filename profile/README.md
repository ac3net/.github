## Autonomous Communication in Cooperative Computer Networks (AC3Net)

This is the official account of the Software Campus microproject [AC3Net](https://softwarecampus.de/en/projekt/ac3net-autonomous-communication-in-cooperative-computer-networks/).

The goal of AC3Net was to improve the cooperation of learning systems in computer networks by allowing them to exchange learnable messages.
Methodologically, the focus was on [reinforcement learning](http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book.html) and [learned communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.08975).

The main result of the microproject is a novel framework that treats networked systems as nodes in a [graph neural network](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~wlh/grl_book/) and conceptually separates these systems from agents.
Within this framework, systems exchange learned messages with other systems in their local neighborhood to iteratively build up a graph representation.
This graph representation may capture local and global features from the whole network and is leveraged by agents to solve the given tasks.
Within the microproject, the feasibility of this framework was demonstrated in the context of a routing environment, where agents have to find the shortest paths to other nodes in the network.
The results show that the framework enables communication systems to learn a sufficient routing protocol, although the agents are only provided a sparse reward signal when they reach their destinations.
This is promising regarding the development of future intelligent communication systems, as the same methodology could be leveraged to improve cooperation in any network of autonomous systems.
